# Ecommerce website for Aazam Wadrove

This was a simple e commerce website I was going to build for a client. But after some days build the app. The client didn't want the website. Now, After some years I thought of making it public so that people could use it for their own purpose.

## Structure of the project

There are only two folder one is for the backend and another one is for the web app. Well the folder names are based on the aliens in Ben 10. The project is 4 years old so the dependencies are old.

| Folder | Details                                                          |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| goop   | Contains the backend code written in elixer                      |
| koko   | Contains the web app which is written in nextjs with tailwindcss |
